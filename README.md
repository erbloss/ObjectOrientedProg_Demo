# ObjectOrientedProg_Demo

A demonstration of basic Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts via handling user input and shapes.  

---

## Overview

This project showcases how to use OOP to model shapes, process user‑input, and manage behavior associated with those shapes. It is meant as a learning/demo tool to:

- Define shape classes with properties and methods  
- Use abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism  
- Allow users to interact (via input) and see results/behaviors of the shapes  

---

## Features

- Several shape classes (e.g. Circle, Rectangle, etc.)  
- Ability to calculate area, perimeter, and possibly other metrics depending on shape  
- Polymorphic behavior: same method name behaving differently across shape types  
- Input validation for user‑provided values  
- Possibly a menu or prompt interface for users to choose shape type and operations
